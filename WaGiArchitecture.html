            <p>
                WaGi is a "shooter" game that can be played o web. Entities that will be
                "killed" are "dificult" questions posted on specific webpages like StackExchange.
                The accumulated score ,after collecting positive votes granted by others, can be
                saved localy or shared on social media.

            <p>
                Nova days is hard to deliver education using formal methods because we face
                big changes in the way we live. Technology is evolving faster and faster and
                is reaching almost to everyone and whatever we do requires a smartphone or a
                PC. Over the years, education has changed very little and is starting to lose
                front against technology. So here we come with WaGi, an educational web application
                that is a game where you can learn new things and to help others to learn.

            <h2>Github Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                We will use the following architecture for working on github.

                    Each branch for different purposes: master for Continuous
                    Integration, feature branches if needed and gh-pages for this report

            <p>
                WaGi will minimally implement the following architecture:
            </p>
            <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                    <img src="WaGi_files/CoDr-arhitecturaPagini.png" width="880" height="655">
                    <figcaption>
                        Each node represents a page (or view or template). All pages inherit from the main template. 2<sup>nd</sup> degree inheritance is relevant only for the <code>Contact</code> page.
                    </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Our server will be made using the open source Node.js runtime
                environment. We made this choice because of
                scalability and the relatively easy learning curve involved.
                Because of our architectural design choice, our app will run on a single thread and will allow thousands of concurrent connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data about user will be received from Stack Exchange API and the score will be saved localy or will can be shared on social media like Facebook.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will aim though for this kind of architecture (even if we implement just a part of it):
            </p>

            <p>
                The server will send to client the code for client pages and after that the pages can run by themselves on client side. The client side wil be separated on login, home and game page. The login will be made using Stack Exchange Login API, the home page will have informations about the game and the game oage will actually implement the game where will extract questions and responses from Stack Exchange, will display them and will calculate the score. When the game is over the user will have the options to share the score on social media or to save it localy.

                Those pages will share the footer and navbar <code>CSS</code> file and a default structure for content container, named <code>style.css</code>. For implementing any specific stilizations each page will have an <code>CSS</code> and maybe <code>JS</code> file named by the title of the page.
