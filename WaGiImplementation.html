            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Our application was made using <code>HTML</code> for pages structure, <code>CSS</code> for page
                stilization and <code>JS</code> for adding special functionalities and behaviors. In total, we have 3
                pages, login (with signup) where you can join our community, home page where you can learn things about
                our application and the play page where you can actually test your knowledge and collect points.
            </p>

            <p>
                The login will be made using Stack Exchange account via Stack Exchange Login API.
            </p>

            <p>
                The home page was made with the purpose to introduce users in the game idea, here, the user can find
                answers for
                questions like "What is WAGI?", "Why to use WAGI?" and "How you can use WAGI."
            </p>

            <p>
                On play page you can start to interact with the game environment. Here you can see questions posted on
                pages like Stack Exchange and some posible responses, from those responses you have to chose the right
                one and to catch it if you can.

        <section typeof="sa:StackExchange" id="stackexchange">
            <h2>StackExchange API</h2>
            <p>
                In order for our app to work , we need the StackExchange API up and running in order to serve us
                questions/answers.
                We made use of the StackExchange API by a simple OAuth2 authorization process , simply by redirecting
                the user to <a href="https://stakexchange.com">StackExchange</a>.
                After giving permission to our app we then proceed to querry the API for questions and answers to be
                displayed in our play page along with some small statistics for a better and more interactive display
                of the data in our dashboard page.
                This was achivied easily by making a small library in order to communicate with the StackExchange
                API.That said we also implemented an event driven approach , in order to avoid blocking the play page
                when queuing up multiple API requests.

        <section typeof="sa:playground" id="playground">
                <h2>Playground</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create the playground we chose to use <code>JS</code> and <code>CSS</code> animations controlled by our <code>JS</code> from <code>play.js</code> script. The idea is that we created a div where to put all the images for background, clouds, hills, trees and bushes with different <code>z-index</code> values and to which we added different <code>CSS</code> classes that will bring images to front or to back of the playground and will atach animations to them. Also, for deers we chose to use a <code>GIF</code> to bring it to live, and depending on from how many frames the <code>GIF</code> is made, we created slow and fast deers. The text bubbles are filled from <code>JS</code> when we receive the question and the corresponding answers. Also we use events like <code>mouseenter</code>, <code>mouseleave</code> and <code>click</code> to make answer bubble to appear and disappear and to simulate the hit on the deer with click (the cursor was changed in crosshair to look like a moving target when it's hover the deers).

            <p>
                As much as we had liked to integrate as many awesome features as we could , we would have liked to have
                a
                bigger database with lots of data in order to compare them with the StackExchange API , just to show
                the user what difference our app makes.
                Also on the agenda is a better question rendering method , with pictures and maybe hyperlinks
                integration.Same goes for the answers displayed on the "deer" hover.
